    full: `• Symptoms: Dark brown to black lesions with concentric rings on older leaves, often described as a "target spot" appearance. These lesions can coalesce, leading to extensive leaf blight.

• Impact: Premature defoliation reduces photosynthetic capacity, leading to smaller tubers and decreased yields.

• Management: Implement crop rotation, remove plant debris, and apply appropriate fungicides when necessary.`,

    imageUrl: "/images/late-blight.jpg",
    full: `• Symptoms: Water-soaked lesions on leaves that rapidly expand, turning brown and leading to leaf collapse. White fungal growth may appear under leaves.

• Impact: Can devastate entire fields within days.

• Management: Use resistant varieties, ensure proper field sanitation, and apply fungicides preventatively.`,

    short: "Upward rolling of leaves with yellowing.",
    imageUrl: "/images/leaf-roll.jpg",
    full: `• Symptoms: Upward rolling of leaves, starting with lower leaves and progressing upward. Affected leaves become leathery and may develop a reddish or purplish tint.

• Impact: Reduces tuber size and yield, can cause internal discoloration of tubers.

• Management: Use certified seed potatoes, control aphid vectors, and remove infected plants.`,

    id: "septoria",
    name: "Septoria Leaf Spot",
    short: "Small dark spots with yellow halos.",
    imageUrl: "/images/septoria.jpg",
    full: `• Symptoms: Small, circular to angular dark spots with yellow halos on leaves. Spots may coalesce as the disease progresses.

• Impact: Reduces photosynthetic area, leading to decreased tuber development.

• Management: Maintain proper plant spacing for good air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, and apply fungicides when necessary.`,

    imageUrl: "/images/psyllid.jpg",
    full: `• Symptoms: Yellowing and upward curling of upper leaves, stunted growth, and aerial tubers may form.

• Impact: Severely reduces yield and quality of tubers.

• Management: Monitor for psyllid insects, use insecticides when necessary, and plant resistant varieties when available.`,

  {
    id: "blackdot",
    name: "Black Dot",
    short: "Small black dots on stems and tubers.",
    imageUrl: "/images/blackdot.jpg",
    full: `• Symptoms: Small black dots (sclerotia) on stems, stolons, and tubers. May cause premature senescence of plants.

• Impact: Reduces tuber quality and marketability, can lead to storage losses.

• Management: Use crop rotation, plant certified seed potatoes, and ensure proper storage conditions.`,

    full: `• Symptoms: Black, slimy decay at the base of stems, yellowing and wilting of foliage, and stunted growth.

• Impact: Can cause complete plant collapse and tuber rot.

• Management: Use certified seed potatoes, avoid planting in wet conditions, and practice good field sanitation.`,
